# Lightstreamer Python client

[Lightstreamer](https://lightstreamer.com/) Python client adapted from [Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-python](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-python).

## Installation

To use current master branch:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mrunderline/lightstreamer-client.git
```

## Note
Tested and reformated espesially for `tadbir.com` push server, but should be fine for other use cases too :)
